A simple Todo-list application

Submission task 4 - Introduction web development

Create a web application for ToDo that contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Enter a task in an <input> field
Click a button to add the task to a list as a <li>
If you click the button when the field is empty, you should get a message saying that you have to write something.
Click on a task <li> in the list to mark it as done (set class so it is styled differently)
Update a small label somewhere with the number of tasks completed.
Click a <li> marked as complete again to mark it as incomplete (requires conditionals)
Click a small trash can on each row to delete that task from the list

The data visible in HTML must also be stored/handled in an array of objects in JavaScript.

The task must be reported as a link to a repo on GitHub.

The web application must be published on GitHub pages.
